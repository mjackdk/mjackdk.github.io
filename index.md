# Open Science Education

## Introduction
Teaching science in secondary school or high school often relies on proprietary lab equipment and related curriculum resources. This is both expensive and limiting.

What if we could develop our own equipment and curriculum?

This page demonstrates how flexible hardware and freely available programming tools can help provide open science education.

### Development Platforms
- Arduino UNO
- BBC micro::bit
- Raspberry Pi 3
- Raspberry Pi Zero W

### Software Development

#### Basic
- Arduino IDE (C/C++)
- Mu editor (MicroPython, CircuitPython, Python 3)

#### Advanced
- JupyterLab (Python 3)
- Atom editor (C/C++, Python 3)
- Visual Studio Code (C/C++, Python 3)

#### Online
- [Arduino Create](https://create.arduino.cc/)


## Projects

### Current

- [AmbientCO2](https://github.com/mjackdk/AmbientCO2): Arduino library for CozIR Ambient CO2 sensor

### Upcoming

- Colorimeter: Arduino library for measuring absorbance
