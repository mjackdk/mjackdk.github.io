# Open Science Education

## Introduction
Teaching science in secondary school or high school often relies on proprietary lab equipment and related curriculum resources. This is both expensive and limiting.

What if we could develop our own equipment and curriculum?

This page demonstrates what flexible hardware and commonly available programming tools can provide. 

### Development Platforms
- Arduino UNO
- BBC micro::bit
- Raspberry Pi 4
- Raspberry Pi Zero

### Software Development
- Arduino IDE (C/C++)
- Mu editor (MicroPython, CircuitPython, Python 3)
- JupyterLab (Python 3)

## Projects

### Current

- [AmbientCO2](https://github.com/mjackdk/AmbientCO2): Arduino library for CozIR Ambient CO2 sensor

### Upcoming

- Colorimeter: Arduino library for measuring absorbance
